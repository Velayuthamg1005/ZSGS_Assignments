// 2. Create a Java application that demonstrates the use of user-defined packages by organising classes based on their functionality.

// arithmetic: This package should include a class that defines methods to perform the following operations on two numbers

package arithmetic;

	public int addition(int a,int b){
		return a+b;
	}
	
	public int subtract(int a,int b){

		return a*b;

		return a/b;
	}
	
	public double modulo(int a,int b){
		return a%b;
